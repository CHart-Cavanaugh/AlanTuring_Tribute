                            Alan Turing was born on June 23, 1912 as the son of a civil servant.

                            He studied mathematics at the University of Cambridge and after graduating, he was elected
                            to a fellowship at King's College for his research in probability theory.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            A couple years later, Turing attended Princeton University for his Ph.D. in mathematical
                            logic under Alonzo Church (who, earlier that year, recommended Turing's paper, "On
                            Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem" for publication after
                            it had reached the same conclusions as a paper he wrote).

                            At start of World War 2, Turing joined the Government Code and Cypher School where he worked
                            as a code breaker throughout the war.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Following the end of the war, Turing joined the National Physical Laboratory (NPL) in London
                            where he was tasked with creating an electronic computer.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Turing later left NPL (after it lost the race to build the first digital computer) and went
                            to join the organization that ended up winning that race (where he made contributions to the
                            first marketable digital computer).

                            A few years later, in the midst of groundbreaking work in researching artificial life,
                            Turing was found dead, poisoned by Cyanide.

                            During his work on the Entsheidungsproblem, Alan Turing invented the universal Turing
                            machine (which established the fundamental logical principles of digital computers).

                            Alan Turing wrote the first-ever programming manual and his programming system was used in
                            the first marketable electronic digital computer.

                            As a founding father of artificial intelligence and modern cognitive science, Alan Turing
                            created the Turing test (which is a criterion used to test whether artificial intelligence
                            is thinking).
